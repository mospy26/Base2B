======= CONFIG FILE INSTRUCTIONS FOR STAGE 2 =======
To enable stage 3, the setting "stage: 3" should be in the config file. Otherwise, stage 2 will run if the number is 2, otherwise stage 1 if no stage is specified.
To enable the testing interface, the settings "stage: 3" and "testMode: on" should be in the config file.
To add obstacles to the stage 3 obstacle layout, the setting in the config file should look like this (without quotes):

"obstacles: OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|..." -- each obstacle is separated by a |

The format for an OBSTACLE looks like this (without quotes):
"WIDTH,HEIGHT,Y_POSITION,SPACING_UNTIL_NEXT_OBSTACLE,COLOUR_RED,COLOUR_BLUE,COLOUR_GREEN,FLY_RATE"

Additional obstacles in order to make at least 2 levels is specified in the config as follows:
"moreObstacles: OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE->OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE->....."

The OBSTACLE has the same format as specified above. -> is a delimiter for different set of obstacles.

======= Testing mode ==========================
The testing mode was extended into more testcases: all powerup testcases, giant stickman destroys obstacle test, large stickman can jump higher test, tiny stickman can walk underneath test, stickman dies test and stickman wins the game test.

======= Behavioural Design Pattern Used =======
Command Pattern
-KeyPressCommand: In order to run and execute the key press events.
-KeyReleasedCommand: In order to run and execute the key released events.

======= Coding Style =======
See README_STAGE1

======= Extensions =======
== Life power up ==
An additional powerup, life powerup in the shape of a green mushroom (like in mario) that provides user with an extra life if grabbed.

== Powerups spawn randomly ==
Powerups spawn randomly on the screen in a level

== Dying animation and winning animation ==
Stickman falls off the screen if died, and stickman makes a slow walk to the right end of the screen if the stickman wins the game.

== Infinite Level mode ==
With the configurable infinite mode in the config file having format :- "infiniteMode: yes/no", the game can have infinite levels (unless the stickman dies)

== Powerups fall from the sky ==
Instead of having the powerups stay on the ground, the powerups fall randomly from the sky.

== Spowning powerups : Giant spawned less frequently ==
Giant powerup is spawned less frequently, since it provides a great advantage to the stickman, hence more valuable.

== Maximum level indicator ==
An indicator indicating how many levels exist in the game "1/3" means that the user is on 1st level out of 3 levels.

== Checkpoint flag ==
A checkpoint flag is placed at the end of every level

== Life score and level score displayed on screen ==
There is a life score indicator on the screen indicating the amount of lives. DisplayScore class was extended from Score class in order to do so.
There is also a level score indicator on the screen. For infinite levels, there is the self intuitive "9999" level score indicating infinite levels.

== Die song and Win song ==
There is a sound effect for dying and winning the mario game.
