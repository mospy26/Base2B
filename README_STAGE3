======= CONFIG FILE INSTRUCTIONS FOR STAGE 2 =======
To enable stage 3, the setting "stage: 3" should be in the config file. Otherwise, stage 2 will run if the number is 2, otherwise stage 1 if no stage is specified.
To enable the testing interface, the settings "stage: 3" and "testMode: on" should be in the config file.
To add obstacles to the stage 3 obstacle layout, the setting in the config file should look like this (without quotes):

"obstacles: OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|..." -- each obstacle is separated by a |

The format for an OBSTACLE looks like this (without quotes):
"WIDTH,HEIGHT,Y_POSITION,SPACING_UNTIL_NEXT_OBSTACLE,COLOUR_RED,COLOUR_BLUE,COLOUR_GREEN,FLY_RATE"

Additional obstacles in order to make at least 2 levels is specified in the config as follows:
"moreObstacles: OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE->OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE->....."

The OBSTACLE has the same format as specified above. -> is a delimiter for different set of obstacles.

======= Testing mode ==========================
The testing mode was extended into more testcases:
1) All powerup grabbing tests (life, giant, large, normal, tiny)
2) Giant stickman destroys obstacle test
3) Large stickman can jump higher test
4) Tiny stickman can walk underneath test
5) Stickman restarts level and loses a life when has more than 1 lives
6) Stickman dies test
7) Stickman wins the game test.

======= Behavioural Design Pattern Used =======
Command Pattern : Encapsulate a request (input request in this case) as an object.
-KeyPressCommand: In order to run and execute the key press events.
-KeyReleasedCommand: In order to run and execute the key released events.

======= Coding Style =======
See README_STAGE1

======= Lives ==============
THe lives are configurable. The config file has a new field:
"lives: x" where x would be the positive number of lives

======= Powerups ===========
Life powerup: Green mushroom
Tiny powerup: Blue mushroom
Normal powerup: Red mushroom
Large powerup: Mario flower
Giant powerup: Yellow mario star

======= Score ============
The score calculation for stage 3 is as follows:
1) 50 points when grabbed a life powerup
2) 30 points when grabbed a giant powerup
3) 10 points for any other powerup
4) 150 points for every obstacle that was destroyed by the giant stickman
5) Lose 100 points for losing a life
6) 500 points for proceeding to the next level
7) 2000 points for winning the game

======= Extensions =======
== Life power up ==
An additional powerup, life powerup in the shape of a green mushroom (like in mario) that provides user with an extra life if grabbed.

== Dying animation and winning animation ==
Stickman falls off the screen if died, and stickman makes a slow walk to the right end of the screen if the stickman wins the game.

== Infinite Level mode ==
With the configurable infinite mode in the config file having format :- "infiniteMode: yes/no", the game can have infinite levels (unless the stickman dies).
In this case, the levels repeat from what was specified in the config i.e. say that 5 levels were specified in the config, then the 5 levels repeat again once the sequence of previous 5 is done.

== Powerups fall from the sky ==
Instead of having the powerups stay on the ground, the powerups fall randomly from the sky.

== Life score and level score displayed on screen ==
There is a life score indicator on the screen indicating the amount of lives. DisplayScore class was extended from Score class in order to do so.
There is also a level score indicator on the screen. For infinite levels, there is the self intuitive "9999" level score indicating infinite levels.

== Spowning powerups : Giant spawned less frequently ==
Giant powerup is spawned less frequently, since it provides a great advantage to the stickman, hence more valuable and should be rare. Rest of the powerups have equal chances of appearing among themselves.

== Maximum level indicator ==
An indicator indicating how many levels exist in the game "1/3" means that the user is on 1st level out of 3 levels.

== Score calculation ==
The score calculation is quite complex. The score calculation is explained above.

== Stickman movement ==
The background moves along with the stickman only after the stickman goes half way past the beginning of the dialog screen.

== Checkpoint flag ==
A checkpoint flag is placed at the end of every level.

== Die song and Win song ==
There is a sound effect for dying and winning the mario game.
