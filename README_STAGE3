======= CONFIG FILE INSTRUCTIONS FOR STAGE 2 =======
To enable stage 3, the setting "stage: 3" should be in the config file. Otherwise, stage 2 will run if the number is 2, otherwise stage 1 if no stage is specified.
To enable the testing interface, the settings "stage: 3" and "testMode: on" should be in the config file.
To add obstacles to the stage 3 obstacle layout, the setting in the config file should look like this (without quotes):

"obstacles: OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|OBSTACLE|..." -- each obstacle is separated by a |

The format for an OBSTACLE looks like this (without quotes):
"WIDTH,HEIGHT,Y_POSITION,SPACING_UNTIL_NEXT_OBSTACLE,COLOUR_RED,COLOUR_BLUE,COLOUR_GREEN,FLY_RATE"
